# Examples

An example directory when working with `Konstraint`

The `pod-container-images` directory contains four files:

- src.rego
- src_test.rego
- constaint.yaml (auto-generated)
- template.yaml (auto-generated)

Running the following command from the root of the repository:

```shell
$ konstraint create examples
```

Will re-generate both `template.yaml` and `constraint.yaml` if the folder name, rego source, and/or library was modified.

## Policies documentation

The `policies.md` file was auto-generated by running the following command from the root of the repository:

```shell
$ konstraint doc examples
```
